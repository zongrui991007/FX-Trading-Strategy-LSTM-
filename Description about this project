The overall task involves using LSTM network as training methodology to analyze effectiveness in forecasting prices of the FX futures mainly on 5-minute USD/CNY data from July 2019 till May 2020 for trading. 
As for the trading strategy, first, use the prediction value to decide when to buy. If the prediction value is higher than the real value, set up an indicator entry as +1, if lower, set -1. Then, calculate the entry differences in each period, buy when entry is +2, sell when entry is -2. Finally, plot the strategy return, and perform technical analysis about the back testing result. The result has shown that LSTM model is not that accuracy in forecasting currency futures but is a feasible way with high return rate to trade currency futures.
